## Black & White
First, [DEMO](http://me.jonathanlurie.fr/BlackAndWhite/).

**Black & White** is a single page project to display a fullscreen white page or a fullscreen black page, then, after a few seconds, even your mouse pointer will be masked, until you move again.

**So, what's the point?**  
At the beginning, I just needed a white fullscreen to use my monitor as a backlight for scanning analog negative films. Then, I realized it would be cool to switch it to black in order to better see all the reflections and marks and clean my screen before scanning the negatives.

**To switch from white to black**, just click anywhere on the page.
